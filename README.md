# Stock Evaluation
The current price of a stock is determined by supply and demand,
i.e. the last price at which a seller and a buyer agree on.
However, the current price doesn't necessarily encapsulate the true value of the company (vs a stock).
The true value of a company depends on how much the company can grow
and how much cash (revenue, gross profit, income etc.) it can generate in the future.

The first stage of this project is a simulator for testing investment strategies.
The user can filter out stocks based on specific parameters and see how these stocks 
performed compared to the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY).
